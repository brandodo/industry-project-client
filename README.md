# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need to clone the server repo in order to run this locally, which you can find [here](https://github.com/brandodo/industry-project-server).


# The Project: FlexoOffice

FlexoOffice is a mobile web based application where employees and employers can provide health check-ins, book workspace, and RVSP to work events, in an effort to re-establish workplace culture prior to the pandemic. 

Feel free to test the application on your mobile device using our dummy account:
